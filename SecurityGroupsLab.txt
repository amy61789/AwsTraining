Security Groups Lab

Notes:
-All inbound traffic is blocked by default
-All outbound traffic is allowed
-Changes to security groups take effect immediately
-You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group
-You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instances
-Security groups are STATEFUL
	-If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again
-You cannot block specific IP addresses using security groups, instead use Network Access Control Lists
-You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules
