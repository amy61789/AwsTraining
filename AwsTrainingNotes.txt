Identity Access Management (IAM)

Critical Terms:
-Users - End users (think people)
-Groups - A collection of users under one set of permissions
-Roles - You can create roles and can then assign them to AWS resources
-Policies - A document that defines one (or more permissions)

Security Token Service (STS):
-Grants users limited and temporary access to AWS resources. Users can come from 3 sources:
	-Federation(typically Active Directory):
		-Uses Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
		-Grants temporary access based off the users Active Directory credentials (does not need to be a user in IAM)
		-Single sign on allows users to login to AWS console without assigning IAM credentials
	-Federation with Mobile Applications:
		-Use Facebook, Amazon, Google or other Open ID providers to login
	-Cross Account Access:
		-Let's users from one AWS account access resources in another
-Federation:
	-Combining or joining a list of users in one domain (such as IAM) with a list of users in another domain (such as Active Directory, Facebook etc)
-Identity Broker:
	-A service that allows you to take an identity from point A and join it (federate it) to point Broker
-Identity Store:
	-Services likes Active Directory, Facebook, Google etc
-Identities:
	-A user of of a service like Facebook
	
IAM Summary:
-IAM consists of the following:
	-Users
	-Groups (A way to group our users and apply policies to them collectively)
	-Roles
	-Policy Documents
	
-IAM is universal. It does not apply to regions at this time.
-The "root account" is simply the account created when first setup AWS account. It has complete Admin access.
-New users have no permissions when first created (this is after root account is setup).
-New users are assigned Access key ID & Secret Access keys when first created.
-These are the same as a password and you cannot use the Access key ID & Secret Access key to login to the console. You can use this to access AWS via the APIs and command line.
-You only get to view these once. If you lose them, you have to regenerate them. SO save them in a secure location.
-Always setup multi-factor authentication on your root account.
-You can create and customise your own password rotation policies.
