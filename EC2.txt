EC2 Elastic Compute Cloud

-Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. (Virtual Machines in the cloud)
-Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Provides developers the tools to build failure resilient application and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

EC2 Options (brief description):
-On Demand
	-Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
-Reserved
	-Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offers a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. (1 year or 3 year terms)
-Spot
	-Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
-Dedicated Hosts
	-Physical EC2 server dedicated to your use. Dedicated hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.
	
EC2 Options Explained:
-On Demand:
	-Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up front payment or long-term commitment.
	-Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
	-Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.
	
-Reserved:
	-Applications with steady state or predictable usage.
	-Applications that require reserved capacity.
	-Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further..
		-Standard RI (up to 75% off on demand)
		-Convertible RI (up to 54% off on demand)
			-Capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange services in the creation of RI of equal or greater value (Windows -> Linux // General Purpose -> CPU Optimized)
		-Scheduled RI's 
			-Available to launch within the time windows you reserve. This option allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, a week, or a month.

-Spot:
	-Applications that have flexible start and end times.
	-Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices.
	-Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.
	
-Dedicated Hosts:
	-Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
	-Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.
	-Can be purchased On Demand (hourly)
	-Can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price
